####This is the place to tell us how you are going to measure your _awesomeness_

# The Idea: To have a Pre Paid payment system for self checkout machines  

We will keep be looking at the following matrix: 

Transactions Matrix 
# Number of users who sign up for the service 
# Number of users who add money to the account 
# Number of users how got to the shops and pay using our system
	> We determine how many people use the self-checkout machines and how many of these use the smartPay. We will aim to get 10% transactions go through our system.
# Repeat customers
	> we will monitor how frequently the users add money their account. 



Store Matrix

# We will first aim at one of the big super markets and integate our system within there stores... 
	> We would see in how many stores our system is implemented and we would like these numbers to increase by time
